                    <p class="postContent">One week from tonight, an NHL team will win the right to draft perhaps the next generational player in the NHL.

                        When the 2023 NHL Draft Lottery is held May 8 (8 p.m. ET; ESPN, SN, TVAS) at NHL Network Studios in Secaucus, New Jersey, the rights to select Connor Bedard at No. 1 will be at stake.
                        
                        Bedard is the top prospect for the 2023 Upper Deck NHL Draft and ranks among the most exciting prospects to ever enter the NHL.
                        
                        He led the Western Hockey League with 143 points (71 goals, 72 assists) in 57 games with Regina, and had 20 points (10 goals, 10 assists) in seven WHL playoff games.
                        
                        That followed the 23 points (nine goals, 14 assists) he had in seven games to help Canada win the gold medal at the 2023 IIHF World Junior Championship. The 17-year-old was named tournament most valuable player and set a Canada record for most points in a WJC.
                        
                        Bedard is No. 1 in NHL Central Scouting's final ranking of North American skaters presented by BioSteel.
                        
                        "Bedard has the elite skills and attributes that the elite NHL players have, and it's the precision in which he reads the play, is always in the right place and how he executes and capitalizes on plays," NHL Central Scouting vice president Dan Marr said. "What places him in that Connor McDavid-special category is his natural presence of mind and instincts that allow him to channel all these attributes to dominate when the opportunity is there and when it's needed most by his team."
                        
                        Only one team can win the NHL Draft Lottery, but fans of many teams already are dreaming of how Bedard would look in their team's jersey and plotting out potential line combinations.
                        
                        Let's take a look at where and how Bedard would fit with each of the 11 teams that have a shot to win the No. 1 pick; while 16 teams will participate in the lottery drawing, teams only can move up a maximum of 10 spots.</p>
