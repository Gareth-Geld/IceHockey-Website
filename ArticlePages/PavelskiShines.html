                    <p class="postContent">Pavelski hadn't played since April 17 because of a concussion he sustained during the second period of Game 1 of the Western Conference First Round against the Minnesota Wild, when he hit his head on the ice following a hard check by defenseman Matt Dumba. Pavelski needed to be helped off the ice by a trainer and teammate Mason Marchment, and was placed in concussion protocol two days later.

                        But any thoughts of Pavelski being rusty were erased quickly. He gave the Stars a 1-0 lead just 2:35 into the first period, and his second, a trademark tip-in, made it 2-1 at 12:18. 
                        
                        Pavelski then single-handedly got Dallas back into the game in the third period. He cut it to 4-3 at 9:50 on the rebound of Jamie Benn's shot before tying it 4-4 at 13:23 when he batted in the puck after Jani Hakanpaa's pass deflected off Kraken defenseman Adam Larsson's stick.
                        
                        Pavelski is the second-oldest player (38 years, 295 days) in NHL history to score a hat trick in the Stanley Cup Playoffs, behind Johnny Bucyk (38 years, 344 days), who did it for the Boston Bruins against the Chicago Black Hawks in Game 2 of the 1974 semifinals. He is also the oldest player to score four goals in a playoff game, surpassing Maurice Richard (35 years, 245 days), who did it for the Montreal Canadiens against the Bruins in Game 1 of the 1957 Stanley Cup Final.</p>
