            <h1 class="Heading">More Rules</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>Face-offs</h2>
                    <p class="ContentPara">Face-offs are used to start periods of play and to restart play after a stoppage. A face-off involves two opposing players standing 
                        opposite each other at roughly one stick’s blade apart and the official dropping the puck between them. The two players then attempt to gain possession of the puck.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Object of the game of ice hockey</h2>
                    <p class="ContentPara"> Simply put, the aim of ice hockey is to score more goals than the opposition by getting the puck into the opposition’s goal. A goal is scored only if all of the puck crosses the entire goal line. It’s illegal to kick the puck across the line or to volley it in, so players must use their stick to hit the puck when it’s in contact with the ice in order to score. 
                        However, deflections off other players — including the goalie (also known as the goaltender) — are also permitted as legal goals.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>How long is a game of ice hockey?</h2>
                    <p class="ContentPara">Matches are played in three 20 minute periods. The clock is stopped every time play stops — which means every second is crucial.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Teams in ice hockey</h2>
                    <p class="ContentPara">Each team can have a maximum number of 20 players, including two goaltenders — although only six players from each team can be on the ice
                         at any one time. Substitutions can be made at any point during the game.
                    </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>The playing zones in ice hockey matches</h2>
                    <p class="ContentPara"> The ice is marked with a series of red and blue lines. The red (center) line divides the ice into two halves, 
                        while the blue lines separate the ice into three equal ‘zones’: a defending zone, a neutral zone and an attacking zone.
                    </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Match officials in ice hockey games</h2>
                    <p class="ContentPara">The referee (who wears a red armband) controls the game and makes the final decision on any matter. The referee is assisted by 
                        linesmen, who are concerned with offside, and goal judges, who look to see whether or not the puck has crossed the goal line.
                    </p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Physical contact in ice hockey</h2>
                    <p class="ContentPara"> At the competitive level, ice hockey has earned a reputation for being an aggressive sport due 
                        to the frequent body checks and other physical contact that occurs on the ice — but it’s not just a free-for-all where players can 
                        get away with what they like. The rules state that contact from the side and front is fine, but deliberate checking (slowing or hindering an opponent) from 
                        behind will usually result in a penalty.
                    </p>
